***Project 1: Gun Sales and Deaths***  
Amazing project. I really like this one, and you could definitely pull from many, many data sources, which is a good skill to learn as a researcher of any kind. How do you get the most, and best, data to help you solve your problem? I will say, though, that you may be limited in data to some degree. Also, it may be challenging to find a large sample of data. You are going to need as many instances of shootings as you can, but even then there won't be *that many* (on the order of 10s, rather than the thousands-millions that we normally work with). Also, depending on the data you can get your hands on, you will have to find an appropriate outcome. Is it frequency of shootings? Is it amount killed? Is it raw occurrence of a shooting over a certain level of severity? Defining your outcome and structuring your problem is key.



***Project 2: Human Trafficking***  
Ibid comments as above. This one, as we discussed, may be even more challenging to both define and get access to data. Depending on what problem you want to solve, it will change what level of data you need. If it's a warning system type model, then you would need individual data, which as we noted is challenging. If it's state-based policy information, then that's more reasonable, but it makes causal inference more challenging. Also, you would need to define policy and encode it into a model (maybe it's raw modeling of text?! Maybe it's levels of policy and it's some indicator variable). I really like this one, and I can tell it is very important to you. Try and get some data, and lets see what you have!


***Project 3: Star Wars***  
Not much to say here. This is a great fallback to work on! I love it.  



*As I mentioned before, take a look at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) to find some fall back datasets. Any dataset is fine, as long as it is well-structured. If things become a bit too difficult, it's very important to have a fallback you can rely on!*
