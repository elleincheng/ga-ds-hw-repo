**Overall:** Good work on this! You presented a thorough analysis/research plan, and you're clearly familiar with some statistical methods for data analysis, which is key to making any claims about data. I truly don't have many comments to make on it!

**Something to think about**

Regarding covariance and generalized linear models (linear regressions/logistic regressions in this case), these are all linear metrics and estimators. Thus, these models will work will if the data is actually linear in structure. If there are some non-linearities, then the models will not work well and may lead to some false conclusions. Non-linear models is an area where the world of Machine Learning has far exceeded traditional statistics methods of estimation. If you are curious, I would be happy to share/discuss more in class!

Check out this KDNuggets post for [outlier analysis](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/02/removing-outliers-standard-deviation-python.html) in Python. An interesting read from a pretty popular Data Science blog, if you aren't familiar.

***Note: Given you already have some solid exposure to statistical analysis, if you ever feel a topic is too elementary or you want more, please ask for some suggestions for more advanced readings! I can send things your way, especially once we get into modeling!***
