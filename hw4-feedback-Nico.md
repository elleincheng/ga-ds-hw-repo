**Overall**  
Great work on this assignment! You walked through the key layout of the problem, your data, your analysis, results, and future things to explore. I appreciated the walk through of each included transformation (the dummy variables and all). When you are walking through your analysis, it's nice, at times, to present some issues that you ran into when working on this problem (why is this problem... a problem?!). Another recommendation is for a few more plots that are associated with your model. For example, a decision tree diagram, predicted probabilities, model performance, roc curves, etc.!

On a final note, most people's presentations in the field will discuss modeling techniques a bit more. Not necessarily just what technique was used, but also why. And, furthermore, what alternatives were considered. There are a lot of ways to attack a problem, so why this one? From there, you can dive into how your model performed and provide some intuition into what the process of creating that algorithm was, and what trouble you ran into.
